# ODSC22 West Workshop: A Hands-on Introduction to Transfer Learning
To learn a new task as we humans need not always start afresh but rather apply previous learned knowledge to perform the new task. In the same way, "transfer learning" allows a machine learning model to port the knowledge it has acquired during previous training of a task to a new task. Transfer learning has lately shown much promise and is very active area of research. In this tutorial session we will discuss the basic theory of transfer learning and few applications with hand on python coding session with tensorflow 2.0. We will briefly discuss some latest applications of transfer learning like privacy preserving ML. <br />
